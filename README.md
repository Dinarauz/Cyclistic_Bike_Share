**Brief history of the company:**
Cyclistic started its bike-share program in 2016, and it has grown significantly since then. There are 5,824 GPS-tracked bikes available across 692 stations in Chicago. Riders can pick up a bike from one station and drop it off at another.

**There are different types of customers:**
* single-ride passes
* full-day passes
* annual memberships.

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

**The goal is:**
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

**Scenario:**
As a junior data analyst working on the marketing team at a Cyclistic bike share company located in Chicago, I have been given a task to find an answer to the "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?" The goal is to convert casual riders into annual members rather than getting a new member. Hence, our team would like to understand casual and members closely. Then we can think of how to create a new marketing strategy to turn casual riders into members.
