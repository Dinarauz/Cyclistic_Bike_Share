**Brief history of the company:**
Cyclistic started its bike-share program in 2016, and it has grown significantly since then. There are 5,824 GPS-tracked bikes available across 692 stations in Chicago. Riders can pick up a bike from one station and drop it off at another.

**There are different types of customers:**
* single-ride passes
* full-day passes
* annual memberships.

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

**The goal is:**
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

**Scenario:**
As a junior data analyst working on the marketing team at a Cyclistic bike share company located in Chicago, I have been given a task to find an answer to the "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?" The goal is to convert casual riders into annual members rather than getting a new member. Hence, our team would like to understand casual and members closely. Then we can think of how to create a new marketing strategy to turn casual riders into members. **My database starts from 12/2023 to 12/2024**

**Discoveries:**
A study revealed that members tend to utilize the bike-sharing system more actively compared to casual riders. Members likely incorporate the system into their daily routines, resulting in a higher frequency of rides. Members showed a preference for weekday usage, while casual riders exhibited higher activity on weekends. Additionally, casual riders displayed a surge in usage during the summer months of June to August, whereas members maintained consistent usage throughout the year. Notably, members favored electric bikes over traditional bikes, whereas casual riders tended to opt for longer rides than members who preferred shorter, traditional bikes and more frequent trips.

**Issues encountered:**
There we a couple of issues encountered during the analysis, first my database had many null values, and second issue was started_at column had many Unknown values. 

**Recommendations:**
The first recommendation is to create promotions for casual members during the summer months since our data showed a peak during the summer months. Also, to create weekend-exclusive memberships to casual members such as discounts to attract them. Finally, create more marketing around popular areas so we can attract more individuals as well as remove locations where bikes are not being used and add to the locations with many offices.
