**Brief history of the company:**
Cyclistic started its bike-share program in 2016, and it has grown significantly since then. There are 5,824 GPS-tracked bikes available across 692 stations in Chicago. Riders can pick up a bike from one station and drop it off at another.

**There are different types of customers:**
* single-ride passes
* full-day passes
* annual memberships.

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

**The goal is:**
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
